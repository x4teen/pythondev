Danny Miner, a 66-year-old retired chemical plant supervisor,
spends most days alone in his Tooele, Utah, apartment, with
reruns to keep him company and a phone that rarely rings.

Old age wasn't supposed to feel this lonely. Mr. Miner married five times,
each bride bringing the promise of lifelong companionship. Three unions
ended in divorce. Two wives died. Now his legs ache and his balance is
faulty, and he's stopped going to church or meeting friends at the
Marine Corps League, a group for former Marines. 'I get a little depressed
from time to time', he says.

Baby boomers are aging alone more than any generation in U.S. history,
and the resulting loneliness is a looming public health threat. About
one in 11 Americans age 50 and older lacks a spouse, partner or living
child, census figures and other research show. That amounts to about
eight million people in the U.S. without close kin, the main source of
companionship in old age, and their share of the population is projected
to grow.
